# anagram

The goal of anagram is to retrieve anagrams of a word from a 
[list of english words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). 

## Installation

You can install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("romainfrancois/anagram")
```

## Example

The main function is `anagrams`

```{r example}
library(anagram)
anagrams("taste")
```

The `r emo::ji("package")` also has the list of english words as a vector

```{r}
sample( english, 10 )  
```

and a tibble of anagram data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data_english %>% 
  filter( n_anagrams == 4) %>% 
  sample_n(10)
```
