# anagram

The goal of anagram is to retrieve anagrams of a word from a 
[list of english words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). 

## Installation

You can install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("romainfrancois/anagram")
```

## Example

The main function is `anagram`

```{r example}
library(anagram)
anagram("taste")
```

The `r emo::ji("package")` also has the list of words as a grouped tibble.

```{r}
withr::with_seed(19820515, 
  dplyr::sample_n( alpha_words, 10 )  
)
```
